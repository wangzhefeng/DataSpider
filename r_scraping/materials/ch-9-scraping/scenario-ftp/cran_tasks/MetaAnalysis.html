      <p>
        This task view covers packages which include facilities for meta-analysis
    of summary statistics from primary studies. The task view does not consider
    the meta-analysis of individual participant data which can be handled by
    any of the standard linear modelling functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard meta-analysis model is a form of weighted least squares and so
   any of the wide range of R packages providing weighted least squares would
   in principle be able to fit the model. The advantage of using a specialised package is
   that (a) it takes care of the small tweaks necessary (b) it provides a range
   of ancillary functions for displaying and investigating the model.
   Where the model is referred to below it is this  model which is meant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where summary statistics are not available a meta-analysis of significance
   levels is possible. This is not completely unconnected with the problem
   of adjustment for multiple comparisons but the packages below which offer this,
   chiefly in the context of genetic data, also offer additional functionality.

        <li>
          The primary studies often use a range of statistics to present their
   results. Convenience functions to convert these onto a common
   metric are presented by:
<a href="../packages/compute.es/index.html">compute.es</a>
          which converts from various statistics to
    d, g, r, z and the log odds ratio,
<a href="../packages/MAc/index.html">MAc</a>
          which converts to correlation coefficients,
<a href="../packages/MAd/index.html">MAd</a>
          which converts to mean differences,
   and
<a href="../packages/metafor/index.html">metafor</a>
          which converts to effect sizes an extensive set of measures
    for comparative studies (such as binary data, person years, mean differences and
    ratios and so on), for studies of association (a wide range of correlation types), for non-comparative
    studies (proportions, incidence rates, and mean change). It also provides for a measure 
    used in psychometrics (Cronbach's alpha).
        </li>

        <li>
          Some packages concentrate on providing a specialised version of the core
    meta-analysis function without providing the range of ancillary

      <h4>
        Multivariate meta-analysis
      </h4>
      <p>
        Standard methods outlined above assume that the effect sizes
   are independent. This assumption may be violated in a number of ways:
   within each primary study multiple treatments may
   be compared to the same control, each primary study may report multiple
   endpoints, or primary studies may be clustered for instance
   because they come from
   the same country or the same research team.
   In these situations where the outcome is multivariate:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a href="../packages/mvmeta/index.html">mvmeta</a>
          assumes the within study covariances
   are known and as well as fixed effects provides a
   variety of options for fitting random effects.
<a href="../packages/metafor/index.html">metafor</a>
          provides fixed effects and likelihood
   based random effects model fitting procedures.
   Both these packages include meta-regression,

   hierarchical models

          is available from R-Forge and
   provides multivariate (and univariate) meta-analysis and
   meta-regression by embedding it in the structural equation framework
   and using OpenMx for the structural equation modelling.
   It can provide a three-level meta-analysis taking account of
   clustering and allowing for level 2 and level 3 heterogeneity.
   It also provides via a two-stage approach
   meta-analysis of correlation or covariance matrices.
        </li>
        <li>
<a href="../packages/dosresmeta/index.html">dosresmeta</a>

      <h4>
        Meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic tests
      </h4>
      <p>
        A special case of multivariate meta-analysis is the case of summarising
    studies of diagnostic tests. This gives rise to a bivariate, binary
    meta-analysis with the within-study correlation assumed zero
    although the between-study correlation is estimated. This is an
    active area of research and a variety of methods are available
    including what is referred to here called Reitsma's
    method, and the heirarchical summary receiver operating
    characteristic (HSROC) method.
    In many situations these are equivalent.

<a href="../packages/mada/index.html">mada</a>
